Analysis of the School District

## What I learned 

Collecting the Data. You will pretty much always use the beginning five lines of code. Importing Pandas, then the OS, third and fourth creating and importing
the data path, then verifying the path was properly imported. What to do? Create a notepad file to hold those 5 lines of code, to save you time.

# Cleaning

Cleaning the data. Very straight forward, and much needed. Computers and Humans can input incorrect data in a spreadsheet, and that can throw off the output
of the analysis completely. So removing and cleaning the files first is important. 

# Drilling Down

Drilling down into the data gets a deep dive into what we are looking for. Using functions such as loc, and iloc. 

# Making Comparisons
Using the groupyby and mean functions, we were able to find and compare certain groups, and finding the averages from them. For example, comparing the student math scores in different schools, then printing out a chart for us to easily see and examine it. 
# Summarize

I have discovered that if you want to sort a value from most to least, you not only need to use the acsending = False function, but you also need to use the inplace = True function with it. Also I learned the difference between the & symbol and the |. They give out two completly different outcomes. You can make your code a lot cleaner, by putting two or more functions in one line. That has helped me stay organized.
